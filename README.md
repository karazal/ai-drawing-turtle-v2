# ai-drawing-turtle
This is a project made by an 11yo boy and his friends (creative input)
This requires the _turtle_ library and *Python 3.11.3* to run.

Explanation: This is a very simple artificial-neural-network and it decides using RNG and radians, square roots, etc.
So this basically creates an artificial neuron that can draw randomly by Turtle's window;
It's useless, but atleast i (the 11boy mentioned earlier) learned some commands and mathematics from it.
